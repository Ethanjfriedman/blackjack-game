This is as basic as it can get:

Press 'start' to begin playing blackjack!

* Once you've begun the game, with a modest bankroll, select an amount to bet on the hand. 
* Then press 'deal' to begin.
* If the dealer has blackjack, you lose. 
* Otherwise, choose: 'double down' to double your initial bet in return for committing to get just one more card total; or choose 'hit' to keep your initial bet level and get an additional car--you can get more than one  if you desire; when you have a hand you're happy with, press 'stand' to stick with it. 
*  Basic blackjack: get as close to or equal to 21 points total without going over. Number cards are worth their face value in points. Jacks, queens, and kings are worth 10 each. Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points. Blackjack is getting 21 points in two cards (with an ace plus any ten-point card).
*  Bets pay out at 1:1 except for a player blackjack, which pays 3:2.
*  If the dealer is showing an ace face up you can buy insurance against a dealer blackjack for 1/2 your original bet, paying out at 2:1.

If you run out of money, pressing 'add money' will use Apple's new iDNA technology to confirm your identity using skin cells
deposited on your mousepad, and then automatically debit the cash into your Blackjack account from your PayPal account.

TODO:
* card animations
* slow down deal
* add in split/multiplayer capability
